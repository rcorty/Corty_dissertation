Hey Paul-- per Greg, this will center your table of contents:
\renewcommand{\contentsname}{\hfill\bfseries\Large TABLE OF CONTENTS\hfill}
\renewcommand{\cftaftertoctitle}{\hfill}
(the one you sent is still a bit off)
Paul Maurizio [12:06]
Thanks!
Dan Oreper [12:06]
I've emailed APM
maybe he can help
Paul Maurizio [12:08]
Which changes, specifically?
Dan Oreper [12:09]
just generally
asking if he has a better latex template
see the email
Paul Maurizio [12:13]
Hi Dan, I see it now.
Dan Oreper [12:16]
Fixed another one! To ensure page numbers on the bottom of chapter pages, edit your layout.tex, at line 9:
% Center chapter titles, omit page numbers.
\titleformat{\chapter}[display]{\fillast\bfseries}{\Large\MakeUppercase{\chaptertitlename} \thechapter}{-11pt}{\huge\singlespacing}
(thats the new, better format)
Dan Oreper [12:23]
and also, for their sizing reqs, get rid of the large and huge
in that same line
Dan Oreper [12:35]
To ensure indentation after section/subsection headers put: \usepackage{indentfirst} into preamble.tex
Paul Maurizio [12:40]
added and commented on this LaTeX/sTeX snippet: Untitled 
% set size of sections to be normal
\titleformat*{\section}{\normalfont\bfseries}
\titleformat*{\subsection}{\normalfont\bfseries}
\titleformat*{\subsubsection}{\normalfont\bfseries}
\titleformat*{\paragraph}{\normalfont\bfseries}
\titleformat*{\subparagraph}{\normalfont\bfseries}
Include this in layout.tex to make sure section headers / subsection headers, etc. are the same size.
Dan Oreper [12:40]
excellent
any ideas on how to get section numbers to appear in the document?
to make up for the uniformity of font size?
it looks like the "report" arg to documentclass should work
but it doesnt
Paul Maurizio [12:43]
I have section numbers in mine. I fiddled with this a bit before, I have to remember what I did.
Paul Maurizio [12:43]
added and commented on this LaTeX/sTeX snippet: Untitled 
% We want numbered subsections %subsubsections
% \setcounter{secnumdepth}{2}
% %\setcounter{secnumdepth}{1}
\setcounter{tocdepth}{1}
Here’s one thing. This goes along with some other changes I made.
Dan Oreper [12:45]
hmm, not working
toc has numbers, but not the body

Paul Maurizio [12:48]
are you using `\section{}` or `\section*{}`?
Dan Oreper [12:53]
\section{}
it looks like its a bug in titlesec package
if you have 2016-3-15 version of titlesec, it gives this incorrect behavior
Paul Maurizio [12:54]
I am not seeing it. Not sure what version of titlesec I have.

titlesec: loss of section numbering with the new update (2016/03/15)
After reinstalling TeXLive distribution (install-tl-20160318, Ubuntu 14.04), a issue occurs with the updated version of the titlesec package: the section numbering is lost. What could it be missin...
thats good!
Dan Oreper [13:05]
in abstract.tex, assuming you are using 11pt font, change \Large to \large
to get an abstract heading that is 12pt
Paul Maurizio [13:05]
ok.
Dan Oreper [13:07]
similarly for acknowledgement.tex
Dan Oreper [13:12]
for reasons that are mysterious, tables.tex requires explicitly:
\renewcommand{\cftlottitlefont}{\hfill\normalsize \bfseries}
(normalsize)
figures.tex on the other hand:
\renewcommand{\cftloftitlefont}{\hfill\bfseries}
(no need for the explicit normal size)
Dan Oreper [13:19]
for talbe of contents, an amended command:
\renewcommand{\contentsname}{\hfill\bfseries\large TABLE OF CONTENTS\hfill}
(large instead of Large)
abbreviations.tex: replace \Large with \large
titlepage.tex:
get rid of all the larges except for the title
for the title, make it \large, and add an uppercase{} call (the uppercase is expected in the grad school format)
references.tex: large instead of Large
Dan Oreper [13:36]
preface.tex: large instead of Large
Our title page has further problems; \vspace{1in} should be there rather than vspace{50pt}. also replace  \vspace{1in} for \vfill
Dan Oreper [13:38]
added this LaTeX/sTeX snippet: titlepage.tex 
\begin{titlepage}

this seems to have handled appendices properly, including all figures, toc, etc:
\addcontentsline{toc}{part}{Appendices}%
\begin{appendices}
\chapter{Supplemental materials for ``Reciprocal F1 Hybrids of two inbred mouse strains reveal parent-of-origin and perinatal diet effects on behavior and expression''}
\input{appendix}
\end{appendices}
\input{appendix} refers to an appendix.tex file i wrote, not relevant to yours
Paul Maurizio [14:16]
Thanks. I did something similar.
Dan Oreper [14:24]
For referring to published/submitted work, the following example seems to fulfill formatting reqs
\chapter[Reciprocal F1 hybrids of two inbred mouse strains reveal parent-of-origin and perinatal diet effects on behavior and expression]{Reciprocal F1 hybrids of two inbred mouse strains reveal parent-of-origin and perinatal diet effects on behavior and expression.
\footnote{This chapter has been adapted from a manuscript submitted to G3. The citation will be as follows: Oreper D., Schoenrock S., McMullan R. C., Ervin R., Farrington J., et al., 2018 Reciprocal F1 hybrids of two inbred mouse strains reveal parent-of-origin and perinatal diet effects on behavior and expression. G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics.}
material within [] shows in the TOC.
Paul Maurizio [14:32]
Yep. That's what I opted to do.

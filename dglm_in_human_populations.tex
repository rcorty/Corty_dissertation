\chapter{Genetic Mapping in Human Cohorts with the Double Generalized Linear Model}
\label{chap:dglm_human}

\cref{part:exchangeable} described a statistical approach that stands on the assumption that all individuals in the mapping population are equally related.
This assumption is appropriate in the analysis of experimental crosses because it is nearly true.
It has been shown that a more general approach that accounts for the slight differential relatedness in an F2 intercross delivers little or no additional benefit in terms of mapping power or precision \citep{Parker2014b}.

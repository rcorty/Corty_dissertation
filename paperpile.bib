  abstract  = "There are two distinct reasons for making comparisons of genetic
               variation for quantitative characters. The first is to compare
               evolvabilities, or ability to respond to selection, and the
               second is to make inferences about the forces that maintain
               genetic variability. Measures of variation that are standardized
               by the trait mean, such as the additive genetic coefficient of
               variation, are appropriate for both purposes. Variation has
               usually been compared as narrow sense heritabilities, but this
               is almost always an inappropriate comparative measure of
               evolvability and variability. Coefficients of variation were
               calculated from 842 estimates of trait means, variances and
               heritabilities in the literature. Traits closely related to
               fitness have higher additive genetic and nongenetic variability
               by the coefficient of variation criterion than characters under
               weak selection. This is the reverse of the accepted conclusion
               based on comparisons of heritability. The low heritability of
               fitness components is best explained by their high residual
               variation. The high additive genetic and residual variability of
               fitness traits might be explained by the great number of genetic
               and environmental events they are affected by, or by a lack of
               stabilizing selection to reduce their phenotypic variance. Over
               one-third of the quantitative genetics papers reviewed did not
               report trait means or variances. Researchers should always
               report these statistics, so that measures of variation
               appropriate to a variety of situations may be calculated.",

  abstract  = "In standard models of quantitative traits, genotypes are assumed
               to differ in mean but not variance of the trait. Here we
               consider directional selection for a quantitative trait for
               which genotypes also confer differences in variability, viewed
               either as differences in residual phenotypic variance when
               individual loci are concerned or as differences in environmental
               variability when the whole genome is considered. At an
               individual locus with additive effects, the selective value of
               the increasing allele is given by ia/sigma + 1/2 ixb/sigma2,
               where i is the selection intensity, x is the standardized
               truncation point, sigma2 is the phenotypic variance, and a/sigma
               and b/sigma2 are the standardized differences in mean and
               variance respectively between genotypes at the locus. Assuming
               additive effects on mean and variance across loci, the response
               to selection on phenotype in mean is isigma2(Am)/sigma + 1/2
               ixcov(Amv)/sigma2 and in variance is icov(Amv)/sigma + 1/2
               ixsigma2(Av)/sigma2, where sigma2(Am) is the (usual) additive
               genetic variance of effects of genes on the mean, sigma2(Av) is
               the corresponding additive genetic variance of their effects on
               the variance, and cov(Amv) is the additive genetic covariance of
               their effects. Changes in variance also have to be corrected for
               any changes due to gene frequency change and for the Bulmer
               effect, and relevant formulae are given. It is shown that
               effects on variance are likely to be greatest when selection is
               intense and when selection is on individual phenotype or within
               family deviation rather than on family mean performance. The
               evidence for and implications of such variability in variance
               are discussed.",

               such differences and an uncertainty which approach to use.
               Assuming the availability of stratified GWAMA results, we

               between-strata differences. For strata of equal size, we find
               that the genome-wide test for difference without any filtering
               is the best approach to detect stratum-specific genetic effects
               with opposite directions, while filtering for overall
               association followed by the difference test is best to identify
               effects that are predominant in one stratum. When there is no a

               both approaches can be recommended. Some approaches violate type
               I error control when conducted in the same data set. For strata
               of unequal size, the best approach depends on whether the
               genetic effect is predominant in the larger or in the smaller
               stratum. Based on real data from GIANT (>175 000 individuals),

  abstract  = "Most genetic studies identify genetic variants associated with
               disease risk or with the mean value of a quantitative trait.
               More rarely, genetic variants associated with variance
               heterogeneity are considered. In this study, we have identified
               such variance SNPs (vSNPs) and examined if these represent
               biological gene x gene or gene x environment interactions or
               statistical artifacts caused by multiple linked genetic variants
               influencing the same phenotype. We have performed a genome-wide
               study, to identify vSNPs associated with variance heterogeneity
               in DNA methylation levels. Genotype data from over ten million
               SNPs, and DNA methylation levels at over 430,000 CpG sites, were
               analyzed in 729 individuals. We identified, vSNPs for 7,195
               CpG-sites (P < 9.4 x 10-11). This is a relatively low number
               compared to 52,335 CpG-sites for which SNPs were associated with
               mean DNA methylation levels. We further showed that variance
               heterogeneity between genotypes mainly represents additional,
               often rare, SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the
               respective vSNP and for some vSNPs multiple low frequency
               variants co-segregating with one of the vSNP-alleles. Our
               results therefore suggest that variance heterogeneity of DNA
               methylation mainly represents phenotypic effects by multiple
               SNPs, rather than biological interactions. Such effects may also
               be important for interpreting variance heterogeneity of more
               complex clinical phenotypes.",

  abstract  = "Mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) is a typical problem of
               regression with uncertain independent variables because the
               genotype of a putative QTL is not observed. Rather, the genotype
               is inferred from marker information. The method of maximum
               likelihood (ML) methods is considered to be the optimal solution
               for this problem because the distribution of the unobserved QTL
               genotype is fully taken into account. The simple linear
               regression method (REG) is a first-order approximation to ML and
               usually performs very well. In this study, an iteratively
               reweighted least squares method (IRWLS) is proposed. The new
               method is a second-order approximation to ML because both the
               expectation and the variance of the unobserved QTL genotype are
               taken into consideration. The IRWLS is developed in the context
               of a single large outbred family. The properties of IRWLS are
               demonstrated and compared with REG and ML via replicated Monte
               Carlo simulations. The conclusions are: (1) when marker
               information content is high, the three methods perform equally
               well, but ML and IRWLS outperform REG when marker information
               content is low and the variance explained by the QTL is high;
               (2) when the residual distribution is not normal, ML can fail or
               have low power to detect small QTLs, but REG and IRWLS are
               robust to non-normality; and (3) when the residual distribution
               is normal, the performance of IRWLS is almost identical to ML,
               but the computational speed of IRWLS is many times faster than
               that of ML.",

               generated by environmental factors? We address this problem for
               a single population of neurons in the mouse CNS. Retinal
               ganglion cells of inbred and outbred strains, wild species and
               subspecies, and F1 hybrids were studied using an unbiased
               electron microscopic method with known technical reliability.
               Ganglion cell numbers among diverse types of mice are highly
               variable, ranging from 32,000 to 87,000. The distribution of all
               cases (n = 252) is close to normal, with a mean of 58,500 and an
               SD of 7800. Genetic factors are most important in controlling
               this variation; 76\% of the variance is heritable and up to 90\%
               is attributable to genetic factors in a broad sense. Strain
               averages have an unanticipated bimodal distribution, with
               distinct peaks at 55,500 and 63,500 cells. Three pairs of
               closely related strains have ganglion cell populations that
               differ by > 20\% (10,000 cells). These findings indicate that
               different alleles at one or two genes have major effects on
               normal variation in ganglion cell number. Nongenetic factors are
               still appreciable and account for a coefficient of variation
               that averages approximately 3.6\% within inbred strains and
               isogenic F1 hybrids. Age- and sex-related differences in neuron

               computer simulation of QTL mapping in the BXD recombinant inbred
               (RI) set compromising 26 strains of mice, and comparisons made

               against both Type I (alpha=.0001) and Type II (beta=.2) errors,
               a QTL would have to account for more than half of the
               between-strain (genetic) variance if the BXD or similar set was

               other) population. In this case, QTLs accounting for
               approximately 16\% of the between-strain variance could be
               detected with an 80\% probability in the BXD set when alpha =
               0.2. To balance the competing goals of minimizing Type I and II
               errors, an economical strategy is to adopt a more stringent
               alpha initially for the RI screen, since this requires only a
               limited genome search in the F2 of the RI-implicated regions
               (approximately 10\% of the F2 genome when p < .01 in the RIs).
               If confirmed QTLs do not account in the aggregate for a
               sufficient proportion of the genetic variance, then a more
               relaxed alpha value can be used in the RI screen to increase the
               statistical power. This flexibility in setting RI alpha values
               is appropriate only when adequate protection against Type I
               errors comes from the F2 (or other) confirmation test(s).",

  abstract  = "The SLC2A9 gene, that encodes a renal uric acid reuptake
               transporter, has genetic variants that explain ∼3\% of variance
               in urate levels. There are previous reports of non-additive
               interaction between SLC2A9 genotype and environmental factors
               which influence urate control. Therefore, our aim was to further
               investigate the general phenomenon that such non-additive
               interactions contribute to genotype-specific association with
               variance at SLC2A9. Data from 14135 European individuals were
               used in this analysis. The measure of variance was derived from
               a ranked inverse normal transformation of residuals obtained by
               regressing known urate-influencing factors (sex, age, and body
               mass index) against urate. Variant rs6449173 showed the most
               significant effect on serum urate variance at SLC2A9 (P = 7.9
               $\times$ 10(-14)), which was maintained after accounting for the
               effect on average serum urate levels (P = 0.022). Noting the
               stronger effect in a sub-cohort that consisted of pre-menopausal
               women and younger men, the participants were stratified into
               males and pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women. This
               revealed a strong effect on variance in pre-menopausal women (P
               = 3.7 $\times$ 10(-5)) with a weak effect in post-menopausal
               women (P = 0.032) and no effect in men (P = 0.22). The T-allele
               of rs6449173, which associates with increased urate levels, was
               associated with the greater variance in urate. There was a
               non-additive interaction between rs6449173 genotype and female
               gender in control of serum urate levels that was driven by a
               greater increase in urate levels associated with the T-allele in
               women. Female hormones, and/or other factors they influence or
               are associated with (such as iron levels, temperature,
               testosterone) interact with SLC2A9 genotype in women to
               determine urate levels. The association of SLC2A9 with greater

               only a minority of the heritable contribution to trait
               variation. Multiple explanations for this 'missing heritability'
               have been proposed. Here we use a large cross between two yeast
               strains to accurately estimate different sources of heritable
               variation for 46 quantitative traits, and to detect underlying
               loci with high statistical power. We find that the detected loci

               contribution to heritability of gene-gene interactions varies

               analytically using a monozygotic (MZ) twin difference design and
               a design using unrelated individuals. The model assumed
               multiplicative or additive effects of alleles on trait variance
               at a bi-allelic locus and an additive (regression) model for
               statistical analysis. If genetic control acts on phenotypic
               variance then the design using unrelated individuals is more
               efficient but 10,000s of observations are needed to detect loci
               explaining at most 3.5\% of the variance of the variance at

               approximately 0.3. For a locus that explains a given proportion

               The scales on which we measure interval-scale quantitative
               traits are man-made and have little intrinsic biological
               relevance. Before claiming a biological interpretation for
               genotype differences in variance, we should be sure that no
               monotonic transformation of the data can reduce or eliminate
               these differences. We show theoretically that for an autosomal
               diallelic SNP, when the three corresponding means are distinct
               so that the variance can be expressed as a quadratic function of
               the mean, there implicitly exists a transformation that will
               tend to equalize the three variances; we also demonstrate how to
               find a transformation that will do this. We investigate the
               validity of Bartlett's test, Box's modification of it, and a
               modified Levene's test to test for differences in variances when

               lines. Methods to analyse these data, based on

               methods are, however, relatively complex and can be

               approximately 50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a
               limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was
               simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding
               every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to
               finite population size N(e) = 100, the marker haplotypes were in
               linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers.
               Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be
               estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were
               included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting
               genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only
               0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects
               assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal

               related to the capacity of animals to adapt to new environmental
               conditions, which can improve animal welfare. RESULTS: We
               developed a ten-generation divergent selection experiment on
               environmental variance. We selected one line of rabbits for
               litter size homogeneity and one line for litter size
               heterogeneity by measuring intra-doe phenotypic variance. We
               proved that environmental variance of litter size is genetically
               determined and can be modified by selection. Response to
               selection was 4.5\% of the original environmental variance per

               We conclude that environmental variance of litter size is

               in improving the mean levels of traits through selection.
               However, in recent decades, reducing the variability of trait
               levels between individuals has become a highly desirable
               objective. Reaching this objective through genetic selection
               requires that there is genetic variation in the variability of
               trait levels, a phenomenon known as genetic heterogeneity of
               environmental (residual) variance. The aim of our study was to
               investigate the potential for genetic improvement of uniformity
               of harvest weight and body size traits (length, depth, and
               width) in the genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) strain.
               In order to quantify the genetic variation in uniformity of
               traits and estimate the genetic correlations between level and
               variance of the traits, double hierarchical generalized linear
               models were applied to individual trait values. RESULTS: Our
               results showed substantial genetic variation in uniformity of
               all analyzed traits, with genetic coefficients of variation for
               residual variance ranging from 39 to 58 \%. Genetic correlation
               between trait level and variance was strongly positive for
               harvest weight (0.60 $\pm$ 0.09), moderate and positive for body
               depth (0.37 $\pm$ 0.13), but not significantly different from 0
               for body length and width. CONCLUSIONS: Our results on the
               genetic variation in uniformity of harvest weight and body size
               traits show good prospects for the genetic improvement of
               uniformity in the GIFT strain. A high and positive genetic
               correlation was estimated between level and variance of harvest
               weight, which suggests that selection for heavier fish will also
               result in more variation in harvest weight. Simultaneous

               quantitative traits as a relevant consequence of genetic
               variation. In this report, we demonstrate that, under plausible
               scenarios of genetic interaction, the variance of a quantitative
               trait is expected to differ among the three possible genotypes
               of a biallelic SNP. Leveraging this observation with Levene's

               prioritize SNPs for subsequent gene-gene and gene-environment
               testing. This method has the advantageous characteristic that
               the interacting covariate need not be known or measured for a
               SNP to be prioritized. Using simulations, we show that this

              allele, strongly confounded with population structure, is
              discovered to be associated with late flowering and slow
              maturation of the plant. The discovered genetic effect on
              flowering time is further replicated in independent datasets.
              Using Mendelian randomization analysis based on summary
              associated statistics from our GWAS and expression QTL (eQTL)
              scans, we predicted and replicated a candidate gene AT1G11560
              that potentially causes this association. Further analysis with
              flowering-time-related genes indicates that this locus is also
              co-selected with many flowering-time-related genes. Our study
              demonstrates the efficiency of multi-phenotype analysis to
              uncover hidden genetic loci masked by population structure. The
              discovered pleiotropic genotype-phenotype map provides new
              insights into understanding the genetic correlation of complex
              traits.",

  abstract  = "KEY MESSAGE: We discovered an unexpected mode of bimodal
               distribution of stable and plastic traits, which was consistent
               for homologous traits of 32 varieties of seven species both in
               well-irrigated fields and dry conditions. We challenged archived
               genetic mapping data for 36 fruit, seed, flower and yield traits
               in tomato and found an unexpected bimodal distribution in one
               measure of trait variability, the mean coefficient of variation,
               with some traits being consistently more variable than others.
               To determine the degree of conservation of this distribution
               among higher plants, we compared 18 homologous phenotypes,
               including yield and seed production, across different crop
               species grown in a common 'crop garden' experiment. The set
               included 32 varieties of tomato, eggplant, pepper, melon,
               watermelon, sunflower and maize. Estimates of canalization were
               obtained using a 'canalization replication' experimental design

               variation of traits, as well as their reaction norms in optimal

               disease traits",
  author    = "Iversen, Maja Winther",
  abstract  = "Traits with low heritability estimates such as health and
               fertility are often assumed to have low genetic variance.
               However, the heritability is a ratio of additive genetic
               variance over all variance, and thus, the genetic variation of
               these traits may only be proportionally small. Health in dairy
               cattle is important, not only in its own right but also for
               human health and animal welfare. The coefficient of variation
               (CV) can be used to express genetic variance without units,
               allowing for comparison between traits regardless of their
               measurement units, in the same way heritability can be used. The
               CV is the standard deviation of the trait divided by the mean.
               In addition, the use of within-family variances may allow for
               more accurate investigation of genetic variance, because when
               within-family variances are large, between family variance
               (which is the basis for heritability estimation) is low.
               However, for international genetic and genomic evaluations,
               phenotypic measurements are not always available. Therefore, the
               aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of using CV
               for observations based on estimated or relative breeding values
               (EBV/RBV), and to investigate whether the low heritability seen
               for health traits, is related to low genetic variance, as
               defined by CV. Data for Brown Swiss cattle from 6 countries
               available from the Interbull evaluation of April 2014 were used
               and CV was calculated for within sire family variances and for
               the population as a whole based on international estimated
               breeding values (IEBV) using SAS 9.3. The breeding values were
               standardised differently for different countries, and were
               separated accordingly. However, there are reasons to believe
               that the interpretation of the results may be complicated
               because of this, and thus the validity of the CV for this
               evaluation may not be justified. If this is ignored for the time
               being, the following results were found. For all traits,
               population CVs were larger than sire-family CVs. Traits had
               either means for breeding values of 100 or 0 depending on the
               country, but there was no correlation between these two types of
               means for individual traits. Differences were found between
               countries for overall mean CV. Differences between different
               categories of traits (e.g. calving, fertility, production) were
               found, with production and fertility traits having the lowest
               overall CV across countries. Within countries, ranking of trait
               categories were somewhat different, but generally workability
               and udder health traits had high CVs. No significant
               correlations were found between the CV of traits and their
               heritability estimates, except when separating traits by
               country. This was only significant for Germany-Austria. Overall,
               the CV is useful for comparing the variance of traits with
               different measurement units. However, because of the nature of
               the breeding values in this study, it may not be appropriate to
               use the CV. Therefore, it is concluded that CV, although useful
               in itself, is not a good approach when evaluating relative
               breeding values across countries.",

  author    = "Ouyang, Weiwei and An, Qiang and Zhao, Jinying and Qin, Huaizhen",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: In functional genomics studies, tests on mean
               heterogeneity have been widely employed to identify
               differentially expressed genes with distinct mean expression
               levels under different experimental conditions. Variance
               heterogeneity (aka, the difference between condition-specific
               variances) of gene expression levels is simply neglected or
               calibrated for as an impediment. The mean heterogeneity in the
               expression level of a gene reflects one aspect of its
               distribution alteration; and variance heterogeneity induced by
               condition change may reflect another aspect. Change in condition
               may alter both mean and some higher-order characteristics of the
               distributions of expression levels of susceptible genes.
               RESULTS: In this report, we put forth a conception of
               mean-variance differentially expressed (MVDE) genes, whose
               expression means and variances are sensitive to the change in
               experimental condition. We mathematically proved the null
               independence of existent mean heterogeneity tests and variance
               heterogeneity tests. Based on the independence, we proposed an
               integrative mean-variance test (IMVT) to combine gene-wise mean
               heterogeneity and variance heterogeneity induced by condition
               change. The IMVT outperformed its competitors under
               comprehensive simulations of normality and Laplace settings. For
               moderate samples, the IMVT well controlled type I error rates,
               and so did existent mean heterogeneity test (i.e., the Welch t
               test (WT), the moderated Welch t test (MWT)) and the procedure
               of separate tests on mean and variance heterogeneities (SMVT),
               but the likelihood ratio test (LRT) severely inflated type I
               error rates. In presence of variance heterogeneity, the IMVT
               appeared noticeably more powerful than all the valid mean
               heterogeneity tests. Application to the gene profiles of
               peripheral circulating B raised solid evidence of informative
               variance heterogeneity. After adjusting for background data
               structure, the IMVT replicated previous discoveries and
               identified novel experiment-wide significant MVDE genes.
               CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate tremendous potential gain of
               integrating informative variance heterogeneity after adjusting
               for global confounders and background data structure. The
               proposed informative integration test better summarizes the
               impacts of condition change on expression distributions of
               susceptible genes than do the existent competitors. Therefore,
               particular attention should be paid to explicitly exploit the
               variance heterogeneity induced by condition change in functional
               genomics analysis.",

  abstract  = "Variation in traits is essential for natural selection to
               operate and genetic and environmental effects can contribute to
               this phenotypic variation. From domesticated populations, we
               know that families can differ in their level of within-family
               variance, which leads to the intriguing situation that
               within-family variance can be heritable. For offspring traits,
               such as birth weight, this implies that within-family variance
               in traits can vary among families and can thus be shaped by
               natural selection. Empirical evidence for this in wild
               populations is however lacking. We investigated whether
               within-family variance in fledging weight is heritable in a wild
               great tit (Parus major) population and whether these differences
               are associated with fitness. We found significant evidence for
               genetic variance in within-family variance. The genetic
               coefficient of variation (GCV) was 0.18 and 0.25, when
               considering fledging weight a parental or offspring trait,
               respectively. We found a significant quadratic relationship
               between within-family variance and fitness: families with low or
               high within-family variance had lower fitness than families with
               intermediate within-family variance. Our results show that
               within-family variance can respond to selection and provides
               evidence for stabilizing selection on within-family variance.",

               itself, but also its environmental variance, is under genetic
               control. Little is known about the relationships between the
               environmental variance of one trait and mean levels of other
               traits, however. A genetic covariance between these is expected
               to lead to nonlinearity between them, for example between birth
               weight and survival of piglets, where animals of extreme weights
               have lower survival. The objectives were to derive this
               nonlinear relationship analytically using multiple regression
               and apply it to data on piglet birth weight and survival. This
               study provides a framework to study such nonlinear relationships
               caused by genetic covariance of environmental variance of one
               trait and the mean of the other. It is shown that positions of
               phenotypic and genetic optima may differ and that genetic
               relationships are likely to be more curvilinear than phenotypic
               relationships, dependent mainly on the environmental correlation
               between these traits. Genetic correlations may change if the
               population means change relative to the optimal phenotypes. Data
               of piglet birth weight and survival show that the presence of
               nonlinearity can be partly explained by the genetic covariance
               between environmental variance of birth weight and survival. The

  abstract  = "Understanding how genes shape phenotypes is essential to assess
               the evolutionary potential of a trait. Identifying the genes
               underlying quantitative behavioral or life-history traits has,
               however, proven to be a major challenge. The majority of these
               traits are phenotypically plastic and different parts of the
               genome can be involved in shaping the trait under different
               environmental conditions. These variable genotype-phenotype
               associations could be one explanation for the limited success of
               genome-wide association studies in such traits. We here use
               avian seasonal timing of breeding, a trait that is highly
               plastic in response to spring temperature, to explore effects of
               such genotype-by-environment interactions in genome-wide
               association studies. We genotyped 2045 great tit females for
               384081 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and recorded their
               egg-laying dates in the wild. When testing for associations
               between SNPs and egg-laying dates, no SNP reached genome-wide
               significance. We then explored whether SNP effects were modified
               by annual spring temperature by formally testing for an
               interaction between SNP effect and temperature. The models
               including the SNP∗temperature interaction performed consistently
               better although no SNP reached genome-wide significance. Our
               results suggest that the effects of genes shaping seasonal
               timing depended on annual spring temperature. Such
               environment-dependent effects are expected for any
               phenotypically plastic trait. Taking these effects into account
               will thus improve the success of detecting genes involved in
               phenotypically plastic traits, thereby leading to a better
               understanding of their evolutionary potential.",

               the existence of genetic control on expected phenotypic
               outcomes. However, there is compelling evidence suggesting the
               existence of genetic control at the level of environmental
               variability, with some genotypes exhibiting more stable and
               others more volatile performance. Understanding the mechanisms
               responsible for environmental variability not only informs
               medical questions but is relevant in evolution and in
               agricultural science. In this work fully sequenced inbred lines
               of Drosophila melanogaster were analyzed to study the nature of
               genetic control of environmental variance for two quantitative
               traits: starvation resistance (SR) and startle response (SL).
               The evidence for genetic control of environmental variance is
               compelling for both traits. Sequence information is incorporated
               in random regression models to study the underlying genetic
               signals, which are shown to be different in the two traits.
               Genomic variance in sexual dimorphism was found for SR but not
               for SL. Indeed, the proportion of variance captured by sequence
               information and the contribution to this variance from four

  author    = "Mestek Boukhibar, Lamia and Barkoulas, Michalis",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Living organisms are continuously confronted with
               perturbations, such as environmental changes that include
               fluctuations in temperature and nutrient availability, or
               genetic changes such as mutations. While some developmental
               systems are affected by such challenges and display variation in
               phenotypic traits, others continue consistently to produce
               invariable phenotypes despite perturbation. This ability of a
               living system to maintain an invariable phenotype in the face of
               perturbations is termed developmental robustness. Biological
               robustness is a phenomenon observed across phyla, and studying
               its mechanisms is central to deciphering the genotype-phenotype
               relationship. Recent work in yeast, animals and plants has shown
               that robustness is genetically controlled and has started to
               reveal the underlying mechinisms behind it. SCOPE AND
               CONCLUSIONS: Studying biological robustness involves focusing on
               an important property of developmental traits, which is the
               phenotypic distribution within a population. This is often
               neglected because the vast majority of developmental biology
               studies instead focus on population aggregates, such as trait
               averages. By drawing on findings in animals and yeast, this
               Viewpoint considers how studies on plant developmental
               robustness may benefit from strict definitions of what is the
               developmental system of choice and what is the relevant
               perturbation, and also from clear distinctions between gene
               effects on the trait mean and the trait variance. Recent
               advances in quantitative developmental biology and
               high-throughput phenotyping now allow the design of targeted
               genetic screens to identify genes that amplify or restrict
               developmental trait variance and to study how variation
               propagates across different phenotypic levels in biological
               systems. The molecular characterization of more quantitative
               trait loci affecting trait variance will provide further
               insights into the evolution of genes modulating developmental
               robustness. The study of robustness mechanisms in closely
               related species will address whether mechanisms of robustness

  abstract  = "Intra-genotypic variability (IGV) occurs when individuals with
               the same genotype, raised in the same environment and then
               tested under the same conditions, express different trait
               values. Game theoretical and bet-hedging models have suggested
               two ways that a single genotype might generate variable
               behaviour when behavioural variation is discrete rather than
               continuous: behavioural polyphenism (a genotype produces
               different types of individuals, each of which consistently
               expresses a different type of behaviour) or stochastic
               variability (a genotype produces one type of individual who
               randomly expresses different types of behaviour over time). We
               first demonstrated significant differences across 14 natural
               genotypes of male Drosophila melanogaster in the variability (as
               measured by entropy) of their microhabitat choice, in an
               experiment in which each fly was allowed free access to four
               different types of habitat. We then tested four hypotheses about
               ways that within-individual variability might contribute to
               differences across genotypes in the variability of microhabitat
               choice. There was no empirical support for three hypotheses
               (behavioural polymorphism, consistent choice, or time-based
               choice), nor could our results be attributed to genotypic
               differences in activity levels. The stochastic variability
               hypothesis accurately predicted the slope and the intercept of
               the relationship across genotypes between entropy at the
               individual level and entropy at the genotype level. However, our
               initial version of the stochastic model slightly but
               significantly overestimated the values of individual entropy for
               each genotype, pointing to specific assumptions of this model
               that might need to be adjusted in future studies of the IGV of
               microhabitat choice. This is among a handful of recent studies
               to document genotypic differences in behavioural IGV, and the
               first to explore ways that genotypic differences in

               estimated mean and environmental variance per cow was used in a
               Bayesian multi-locus model to identify SNP associated with
               either the mean or the environmental variance of SCS. Based on
               the obtained accuracy of genome-wide breeding values, 985 and
               541 independent chromosome segments affecting the mean and
               environmental variance of SCS, respectively, were identified.
               Using a genomic relationship matrix increased the accuracy of
               breeding values relative to using a pedigree relationship
               matrix. In total, 43 SNP were significantly associated with
               either the mean (22) or the environmental variance of SCS (21).
               The SNP with the highest Bayes factor was on chromosome 9
               (Hapmap31053-BTA-111664) explaining approximately 3\% of the
               genetic variance of the environmental variance of SCS. Other
               significant SNP explained less than 1\% of the genetic variance.
               It can be concluded that fewer genomic regions affect the
               environmental variance of SCS than the mean of SCS, but genes
               with large effects seem to be absent for both traits.",

  abstract  = "Two principal methods are commonly employed for the estimation
               of developmental instability at the population level. Some
               studies use variances of morphological traits ($\sigma$2p),
               while others use fluctuating asymmetry (FA). In both cases,
               differences in the degree of developmental instability can be
               tested with an F-test, which is the most common way to compare
               variances. However, the variance is expected to scale
               proportionally to the square of the mean as there is a tendency
               in biological data for $\sigma$2p to scale proportionally to the
               square of the mean ( ): $\sigma$2p = Z $\xi$, where $\xi$ is the
               scaling exponent, which is expected to be two for pure
               statistical reasons, is the mean of the trait and Z is a measure
               of individual-level variability. Because of this scaling effect,
               the fluctuating asymmetry will be affected, FA is estimated as
               the variance between the right and the left sides of a trait
               ($\sigma$2r − l = $\sigma$2r + $\sigma$2l −
               2r$\sigma$r$\sigma$l), where $\sigma$2r and $\sigma$2l are the
               variances of the right and the left trait values, respectively.
               In this paper, we propose a novel method that allows an exact
               correction of the scaling effect, which will enable a proper
               comparison of the degree of fluctuating asymmetry for a trait.
               The problem of the scaling of the FA with the trait size is
               quite crucial if FA is to be considered an indicator of fitness
               or an indicator of environmental or genetic stress, as different
               stresses or fitness levels are typically accompanied by a change

               probabilistic effect of a single SNP on cell shape was detected

               with elevated gene expression noise of the yeast galactose
               regulon. Our results illustrate how single-cell technologies can
               be exploited to improve the genetic dissection of certain common

               crop yield potential is a trait with a clear genetic component,
               which can be successfully selected for at the single-plant level
               and incorporated into high-yielding cultivars. Two novel
               selection equations with prognostic power are presented, capable
               to objectively phenotype and evaluate individual plants in real
               field conditions in the absence of the masking effects of
               interplant competition and soil heterogeneity. The equations
               predict performance at the crop stand through the key concept of
               coefficient of homeostasis and are equally useful for early
               generation selection and for nonstop selection within finished
               cultivars in order to continuously incorporate the adaptive
               (genetic or epigenetic) responses of plants. Exploitation of

               important focus in the population genetic literature. Previous
               studies have shown that evolution under temporal variation is
               determined not only by expected fitness in a given generation,
               but also by the degree of variation in fitness over generations;
               in an uncertain environment, alleles that increase the geometric
               mean fitness can invade a randomly mating population at
               equilibrium. This geometric mean principle governs the
               evolutionary interplay of genes controlling mean phenotype and
               genes controlling phenotypic variation, such as genetic
               regulators of the epigenetic machinery. Thus, it establishes an
               important role for stochastic epigenetic variation in adaptation
               to fluctuating environments: by modifying the geometric mean
               fitness, variance-modifying genes can change the course of
               evolution and determine the long-term trajectory of the evolving
               system. The role of phenotypic variance has previously been
               studied in systems in which the only driving force is natural
               selection, and there is no recombination between mean- and
               variance-modifying genes. Here, we develop a population genetic

              Holstein cows located in one region in Eastern Germany including
              690,553 first lactation test day production records. Estimates of
              variance components revealed heterogeneity of genetic variances
              across subsets and the highest additive genetic variances and
              heritabilities were found in larger herds with high production
              level and low age at first calving. Special cooperator herds for
              dairy cattle progeny testing programs will be a common practice
              in the near future. Suitable selection criteria for cooperator
              herds should consider genetic parameters, e.g. genetic variances
              and heritabilities within herds or subsets, to identify
              genetically superior sires as accurately as possible. As shown in
              the present study, the two‐step cluster analysis is an
              appropriate method to combine all desirable effects of herd
              parameters for a final selection of cooperator herds. One cluster
              included 44 large‐scale dairy farms with an average of 638 cows

              acceptable time. Rank correlations of estimated breeding values

              for high-yield herds and lower (maximum of 15\%) for low-yield
              herds. Permanent environmental variances were on average 10\%

              approximately 10\% at start of lactation and then began to
              decrease regardless of herd yield; high-yield herds increased in
              midlactation followed by another decrease, and medium-yield herds

              variances if the necessary variance components are known; this
              may require estimation of variance components within each
              heterogeneous subclass. Properties of sire and residual variance
              estimates obtained by an empirical Bayes approach, which combines
              within-herd and prior estimates, were examined via simulation.
              Prior estimates were obtained using REML across herds, as if
              variances were homogeneous. Convergence was improved by
              incorporation of prior information such that variance component
              estimates could be obtained in within-herd situations for which a
              REML algorithm failed to converge. Accuracy of sire variance
              estimates was greatest when both within-herd and prior
              information were used, but improvement in accuracy of residual
              variance estimates associated with incorporation of prior
              information was minimal. Correlations between sires' standardized
              true transmitting abilities and PTA that used empirical Bayes
              variance estimates were larger than those obtained when
              heterogeneity was ignored. Proportions of sires selected, based
              on standardized PTA, from environments with differing genetic and
              residual variances became more uniform as the relative weight
              placed on within-herd data in variance estimation increased.
              Thus, useful variance component estimates can be obtained within
              individual herds by using empirical Bayes methods with
              across-herd estimates as prior information; this may allow
              prediction of breeding values that are less influenced by
              heterogeneous variances.",

              Factors such as region, year of calving and management level of
              the herd were found to be associated to heterogeneity of
              herd-period variances in a correspondence analysis. Applying
              clustering techniques, initial 36781 herd-periods were stratified
              into 38 subclasses defined by combinations of levels of those
              factors. A statistical analysis that used a structural model on
              log-variances showed that a significant amount of the observed
              variability among herd-period variances could be explained by the
              defined subclasses. Variability between subclasses was 62.8\% of
              the total between and within true variability. The herd-period
              stratification was used to obtain estimates of herd-period milk
              yield variances in a Bayesian analysis. These estimates were then
              applied to produce standardized milk yield records. Genetic
              evaluations were run on standardized and unstandardized data.
              Genetic evaluation of cows was noticeably affected by
              standardization. Twenty percent of cows in the 1000 best cows
              list were excluded from the list when standardization was
              performed. Estimated correlation coefficient between the two
              evaluations for these cows was 0.82. Bulls evaluation was
              affected to a less extent. Only 9\% of the top 100 bulls were out
              of the 100 top list after standardization. A slight tendency to
              use North American bulls from the most variable herds was
              observed. However, this fact did not imply significant changes in

              phenotypic variance estimate was combined with those of adjacent

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The genetic architecture of a quantitative trait
               influences the phenotypic response to natural or artificial
               selection. One of the main objectives of genetic mapping studies
               is to identify the genetic factors underlying complex traits and
               understand how they contribute to phenotypic expression.
               Presently, we are good at identifying and locating individual
               loci with large effects, but there is a void in describing more
               complex genetic architectures. Although large networks of
               connected genes have been reported, there is an almost complete
               lack of information on how polymorphisms in these networks
               contribute to phenotypic variation and change. To date, most of
               our understanding comes from theoretical, model-based studies,
               and it remains difficult to assess how realistic their
               conclusions are as they lack empirical support. RESULTS: A
               previous study provided evidence that nearly half of the
               difference in eight-week body weight between two divergently
               selected lines of chickens was a result of four loci organized
               in a 'radial' network (one central locus interacting with three
               'radial' loci that, in turn, only interacted with the central
               locus). Here, we study the relationship between phenotypic
               change and genetic polymorphism in this empirically detected
               network. We use a model-free approach to study, through
               individual-based simulations, the dynamic properties of this
               polymorphic and epistatic genetic architecture. The study
               provides new insights to how epistasis can modify the selection
               response, buffer and reveal effects of major loci leading to a
               progressive release of genetic variation. We also illustrate the
               difficulty of predicting genetic architecture from observed
               selection response, and discuss mechanisms that might lead to
               misleading conclusions on underlying genetic architectures from
               quantitative trait locus (QTL) experiments in selected
               populations. CONCLUSION: Considering both molecular (QTL) and
               phenotypic (selection response) data, as suggested in this work,
               provides additional insights into the genetic mechanisms
               involved in the response to selection. Such dissection of
               genetic architectures and in-depth studies of their ability to
               contribute to short- or long-term selection response represents
               an important step towards a better understanding of the genetic
               bases of complex traits and, consequently, of the evolutionary

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Presence of interaction between a genotype and
               certain factor in determination of a trait's value, it is
               expected that the trait's variance is increased in the group of
               subjects having this genotype. Thus, test of heterogeneity of
               variances can be used as a test to screen for potentially
               interacting single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this
               work, we evaluated statistical properties of variance
               heterogeneity analysis in respect to the detection of
               potentially interacting SNPs in a case when an interaction
               variable is unknown. RESULTS: Through simulations, we
               investigated type I error for Bartlett's test, Bartlett's test
               with prior rank transformation of a trait to normality, and
               Levene's test for different genetic models. Additionally, we
               derived an analytical expression for power estimation. We showed
               that Bartlett's test has acceptable type I error in the case of
               trait following a normal distribution, whereas Levene's test
               kept nominal Type I error under all scenarios investigated. For
               the power of variance homogeneity test, we showed (as opposed to
               the power of direct test which uses information about known
               interacting factor) that, given the same interaction effect, the
               power can vary widely depending on the non-estimable direct
               effect of the unobserved interacting variable. Thus, for a given
               interaction effect, only very wide limits of power of the
               variance homogeneity test can be estimated. Also we applied
               Levene's approach to test genome-wide homogeneity of variances
               of the C-reactive protein in the Rotterdam Study population (n =
               5959). In this analysis, we replicate previous results of Pare
               and colleagues (2010) for the SNP rs12753193 (n = 21,799).
               CONCLUSIONS: Screening for differences in variances among
               genotypes of a SNP is a promising approach as a number of
               biologically interesting models may lead to the heterogeneity of
               variances. However, it should be kept in mind that the absence
               of variance heterogeneity for a SNP can not be interpreted as
               the absence of involvement of the SNP in the interaction

               variation. Many statistical methods have been developed to model
               and identify epistatic interactions between genetic variants.
               However, because of the large combinatorial search space of
               interactions, most epistasis mapping methods face enormous
               computational challenges and often suffer from low statistical
               power due to multiple test correction. Here, we present a novel,
               alternative strategy for mapping epistasis: instead of directly
               identifying individual pairwise or higher-order interactions, we
               focus on mapping variants that have non-zero marginal epistatic
               effects-the combined pairwise interaction effects between a
               given variant and all other variants. By testing marginal
               epistatic effects, we can identify candidate variants that are
               involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact
               partners with which the variants interact, thus potentially
               alleviating much of the statistical and computational burden
               associated with standard epistatic mapping procedures. Our
               method is based on a variance component model, and relies on a
               recently developed variance component estimation method for
               efficient parameter inference and p-value computation. We refer
               to our method as the ``MArginal ePIstasis Test'', or MAPIT. With

               marginal epistatic effects, produce calibrated test statistics
               under the null, and facilitate the detection of pairwise
               epistatic interactions. We further illustrate the benefits of

  abstract  = "There is evidence across several species for genetic control of
               phenotypic variation of complex traits, such that the variance
               among phenotypes is genotype dependent. Understanding genetic
               control of variability is important in evolutionary biology,
               agricultural selection programmes and human medicine, yet for
               complex traits, no individual genetic variants associated with
               variance, as opposed to the mean, have been identified. Here we
               perform a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of
               phenotypic variation using ∼170,000 samples on height and body
               mass index (BMI) in human populations. We report evidence that
               the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7202116 at the FTO
               gene locus, which is known to be associated with obesity (as
               measured by mean BMI for each rs7202116 genotype), is also
               associated with phenotypic variability. We show that the results
               are not due to scale effects or other artefacts, and find no
               other experiment-wise significant evidence for effects on
               variability, either at loci other than FTO for BMI or at any
               locus for height. The difference in variance for BMI among
               individuals with opposite homozygous genotypes at the FTO locus
               is approximately 7\%, corresponding to a difference of ∼0.5
               kilograms in the standard deviation of weight. Our results
               indicate that genetic variants can be discovered that are
               associated with variability, and that between-person variability
               in obesity can partly be explained by the genotype at the FTO
               locus. The results are consistent with reported FTO by
               environment interactions for BMI, possibly mediated by DNA
               methylation. Our BMI results for other SNPs and our height
               results for all SNPs suggest that most genetic variants,
               including those that influence mean height or mean BMI, are not
               associated with phenotypic variance, or that their effects on
               variability are too small to detect even with samples sizes
               greater than 100,000.",

               in phenotype that cannot be explained by genetic variation or
               identifiable genetic differences - can be regarded as being
               under some degree of genetic control. Such variation may be
               either between repeated expressions of the same trait within
               individuals (e.g. for bilateral traits), in the phenotype of
               different individuals, where variation within families may
               differ, or in both components. We consider alternative models
               for defining the distribution of phenotypes to include a
               component due to heterogeneity of VE. We review evidence for the
               presence of genetic variation in VE and estimates of its
               magnitude. Typically the heritability of VE is under 10\%, but
               its genetic coefficient of variation is typically 20\% or more.
               We consider experimental designs appropriate for estimating
               genetic variance in VE and review alternative methods of
               estimation. We consider the effects of stabilizing and
               directional selection on VE and review both the forces that
               might be maintaining levels of VE and heritability found in
               populations. We also evaluate the opportunities for reducing VE
               in breeding programmes. Although empirical and theoretical

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Many studies have provided evidence of the existence
               of genetic heterogeneity of environmental variance, suggesting
               that it could be exploited to improve robustness and uniformity
               of livestock by selection. However, little is known about the
               perspectives of such a selection strategy in beef cattle.
               METHODS: A two-step approach was applied to study the genetic
               heterogeneity of residual variance of weight gain from birth to
               weaning and long-yearling weight in a Nellore beef cattle
               population. First, an animal model was fitted to the data and
               second, the influence of additive and environmental effects on
               the residual variance of these traits was investigated with
               different models, in which the log squared estimated residuals
               for each phenotypic record were analyzed using the restricted
               maximum likelihood method. Monte Carlo simulation was performed
               to assess the reliability of variance component estimates from
               the second step and the accuracy of estimated breeding values
               for residual variation. RESULTS: The results suggest that both
               genetic and environmental factors have an effect on the residual
               variance of weight gain from birth to weaning and long-yearling
               in Nellore beef cattle and that uniformity of these traits could
               be improved by selecting for lower residual variance, when
               considering a large amount of information to predict genetic
               merit for this criterion. Simulations suggested that using the
               two-step approach would lead to biased estimates of variance
               components, such that more adequate methods are needed to study
               the genetic heterogeneity of residual variance in beef cattle.",

               account for the heterogenous genetic variances that exist

               models to allow for residual heteroskedasticity (heterogeneous

               (e.g., sex, breed proportion, breed group heterozygosity) and
               random effects such as contemporary groups (CG). We additionally
               specify the residual distributions to be either Gaussian or
               based on heavier-tailed alternatives such as the Student's t or
               Slash densities. For each of these three residual densities
               using either homoskedastic (homogeneous variance) or
               heteroskedastic error specifications, we analyzed 22,717
               postweaning gain records from a Nelore-Hereford population based
               on a Markov chain Monte Carlo animal model implementation. The
               heteroskedastic Student's t error model (with estimated df =
               7.33 +/- 0.48) was clearly the best-fitting model based on a
               pseudo-Bayes factor criterion. Breed group heterozygosity and,
               to a lesser extent, calf sex seemed to be marginally important
               sources of residual heteroskedasticity. Specifically, the
               residual variance in F1 animals was estimated to be 0.70 +/-
               0.16 times that for purebreds, whereas the male residual
               variance was estimated to be 1.13 +/- 0.09 times that for
               females. The CG effects were important random sources of
               residual heteroskedasticity (i.e., the coefficient of variation
               of CG-specific residual variances was estimated to be 0.72 +/-
               0.06). Purebred Nelores were estimated to have a larger genetic
               variance (124.84 +/- 21.75 kg2) compared with Herefords (40.89
               +/- 6.70 kg2) under the heteroskedastic Student's t error model;
               however, the converse was observed from results based on a
               homoskedastic Student's t error model (46.24 +/- 10.90 kg2 and
               60.11 +/- 8.54 kg2, respectively). These results indicate that
               allowing for robustness to outliers and accounting for
               heteroskedasticity of residual variances has potentially
               important implications for variance component and genetic

               variance and between female and male residual variance for
               broilers. The data sets comprised 26 972 female and 24 407 male

               area of research in plant breeding. Non-parallelism of those
               responses is called genotype by environment interaction (GEI).
               GEI especially affects plant breeding strategies, when the
               phenotypic superiority of genotypes changes in relation to the
               environment. The study of the genetic basis of GEI involves the
               modelling of quantitative trait locus (QTL) expression in its
               dependence on environmental factors. We present a modelling
               framework for studying the interaction between QTL and
               environment, using regression models in a mixed model context.
               We integrate regression models for QTL main effect expression

               pairs where none of the QTL can be detected by their marginal

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Genetic variation for environmental sensitivity
               indicates that animals are genetically different in their
               response to environmental factors. Environmental factors are
               either identifiable (e.g. temperature) and called
               macro-environmental or unknown and called micro-environmental.
               The objectives of this study were to develop a statistical
               method to estimate genetic parameters for macro- and
               micro-environmental sensitivities simultaneously, to investigate
               bias and precision of resulting estimates of genetic parameters
               and to develop and evaluate use of Akaike's information
               criterion using h-likelihood to select the best fitting model.
               METHODS: We assumed that genetic variation in macro- and
               micro-environmental sensitivities is expressed as genetic
               variance in the slope of a linear reaction norm and
               environmental variance, respectively. A reaction norm model to
               estimate genetic variance for macro-environmental sensitivity
               was combined with a structural model for residual variance to
               estimate genetic variance for micro-environmental sensitivity
               using a double hierarchical generalized linear model in ASReml.
               Akaike's information criterion was constructed as model
               selection criterion using approximated h-likelihood. Populations
               of sires with large half-sib offspring groups were simulated to
               investigate bias and precision of estimated genetic parameters.
               RESULTS: Designs with 100 sires, each with at least 100
               offspring, are required to have standard deviations of estimated
               variances lower than 50\% of the true value. When the number of
               offspring increased, standard deviations of estimates across
               replicates decreased substantially, especially for genetic
               variances of macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities.
               Standard deviations of estimated genetic correlations across
               replicates were quite large (between 0.1 and 0.4), especially
               when sires had few offspring. Practically, no bias was observed
               for estimates of any of the parameters. Using Akaike's
               information criterion the true genetic model was selected as the
               best statistical model in at least 90\% of 100 replicates when
               the number of offspring per sire was 100. Application of the
               model to lactation milk yield in dairy cattle showed that
               genetic variance for micro- and macro-environmental
               sensitivities existed. CONCLUSION: The algorithm and model
               selection criterion presented here can contribute to better
               understand genetic control of macro- and micro-environmental
               sensitivities. Designs or datasets should have at least 100
               sires each with 100 offspring.",

               among animals and may be under genetic control. It is essential
               to take this element into account when aiming at breeding robust
               farm animals. Here, linear mixed models with genetic effects in
               the residual variance part of the model can be used. Such models
               have previously been fitted using EM and MCMC algorithms.
               RESULTS: We propose the use of double hierarchical generalized
               linear models (DHGLM), where the squared residuals are assumed
               to be gamma distributed and the residual variance is fitted
               using a generalized linear model. The algorithm iterates between
               two sets of mixed model equations, one on the level of
               observations and one on the level of variances. The method was
               validated using simulations and also by re-analyzing a data set
               on pig litter size that was previously analyzed using a Bayesian
               approach. The pig litter size data contained 10,060 records from
               4,149 sows. The DHGLM was implemented using the ASReml software
               and the algorithm converged within three minutes on a Linux
               server. The estimates were similar to those previously obtained
               using Bayesian methodology, especially the variance components
               in the residual variance part of the model. CONCLUSIONS: We have
               shown that variance components in the residual variance part of
               a linear mixed model can be estimated using a DHGLM approach.
               The method enables analyses of animal models with large numbers
               of observations. An important future development of the DHGLM
               methodology is to include the genetic correlation between the
               random effects in the mean and residual variance parts of the
               model as a parameter of the DHGLM.",

               variation in genotype produces a change in that trait's average
               value. But focusing on differences in the mean ignores
               differences in variability about that mean. The robustness, or
               uniformity, of an individual's character is not only of great
               practical importance in medical genetics and food production but
               is also of scientific and evolutionary interest (e.g., blood
               pressure in animal models of heart disease, litter size in pigs,

               animals expressing a small response to environment has been
               studied extensively in animal breeding. Bayesian methods for
               fitting models with genetic components in the residual variance
               have been developed for this purpose, but have limitations due
               to the computational demands. We use the hierarchical
               (h)-likelihood from the theory of double hierarchical
               generalized linear models (DHGLM) to derive an estimation
               algorithm that is computationally feasible for large datasets.
               Random effects for both the mean and residual variance parts of
               the model are estimated together with their variance/covariance
               components. An important feature of the algorithm is that it can
               fit a correlation between the random effects for mean and
               variance. An h-likelihood estimator is implemented in the R
               software and an iterative reweighted least square (IRWLS)
               approximation of the h-likelihood is implemented using ASReml.
               The difference in variance component estimates between the two
               implementations is investigated, as well as the potential bias
               of the methods, using simulations. IRWLS gives the same results
               as h-likelihood in simple cases with no severe indication of
               bias. For more complex cases, only IRWLS could be used, and bias

               isogenic cells or organisms that later manifest different fates.
               For example, in isogenic populations of young adult
               Caenorhabditis elegans, differences in Green Fluorescent Protein
               (GFP) expressed from the hsp-16.2 promoter predict differences
               in life span. Thus, it is of interest to determine how
               interindividual differences in biomarker gene expression arise.
               Prior reports showed that the thermosensory neurons and insulin
               signaling systems controlled the magnitude of the heat shock
               response, including absolute expression of hsp-16.2. Here, we
               tested whether these regulatory signals might also influence

               showed that the action of AFD thermosensory neurons increases

               to decrease interindividual variation in life-span biomarker
               expression; in other words, insulin signaling canalizes
               expression of the hsp-16.2-driven life-span biomarker. Our
               results show that specific signaling systems regulate not only
               expression level, but also the amount of interindividual
               expression variation for a life-span biomarker gene. They raise

               variability in urine chemistries. Based on these findings, we
               hypothesized that sex would similarly be associated with

               on residuals might affect the establishment of physiological
               baselines and error in medical assays. METHODS: We tested the
               effects of sex on residual variation in urine chemistry by
               estimating coefficients of variation (CV) for urinary solutes in
               paired sequential 24-h urines ($\leq$72 hour interval) in 6,758
               females and 9,024 males aged 16-80 submitted to a clinical
               laboratory. RESULTS: Females had higher CVs than males for
               urinary phosphorus overall at the False Discovery Rate (P0.3).
               Males had higher CVs for citrate (P<0.01) from ages 16-45 and

               the addition of random error to phenotypic assays. Renal

               environments and the maintenance of intraspecific variation. The
               epiphenotype hypothesis posits that the timing of development
               can constrain plasticity-the earlier alternate phenotypes begin
               to develop, the greater the difference that can result amongst
               the final traits. This research extends this idea by considering
               how life history timing shapes the opportunity for the
               environment to influence trait development. We test the
               prediction that the earlier an individual begins to actively
               interact with and explore their environment, the greater the
               opportunity for plasticity and thus variation in foraging
               traits. This research focuses on life history variation across
               four groups of birds using museum specimens and measurements
               from the literature. We reasoned that greater phenotypic
               plasticity, through either environmental effects or
               genotype-by-environment interactions in development, would be
               manifest in larger trait ranges (bills and tarsi) within
               species. Among shorebirds and ducks, we found that species with
               relatively shorter incubation times tended to show greater
               phenotypic variation. Across warblers and sparrows, we found
               little support linking timing of flight and trait variation.
               Overall, our results also suggest a pattern between body size
               and trait variation, consistent with constraints on egg size
               that might result in larger species having more environmental
               influences on development. Taken together, our results provide
               some support for the hypothesis that variation in life histories
               affects how the environment shapes development, through either
               the expression of plasticity or the release of cryptic genetic
               variation.",

               scenarios where invariant phenotypes are optimal and assume that
               developmental mechanisms have evolved to buffer the phenotypes
               of specific traits against stochastic and environmental
               perturbations. However, plastic plant phenotypes that vary
               between environments or variable phenotypes that vary
               stochastically within an environment may also be advantageous in
               some scenarios. SCOPE: Here the conditions under which
               invariant, plastic and variable phenotypes of specific traits
               may confer a selective advantage in plants are examined. Drawing
               on work from microbes and multicellular organisms, the
               mechanisms that may give rise to each type of phenotype are
               discussed. CONCLUSION: In contrast to the view of robustness as
               being the ability of a genotype to produce a single, invariant
               phenotype, changes in a phenotype in response to the
               environment, or phenotypic variability within an environment,
               may also be delivered consistently (i.e. robustly). Thus, for
               some plant traits, mechanisms have probably evolved to produce
               plasticity or variability in a reliable manner.",

  abstract  = "Quantitative genetic analysis has long been used to study how
               natural variation of genotype can influence an organism's
               phenotype. While most studies have focused on genetic
               determinants of phenotypic average, it is rapidly becoming
               understood that stochastic noise is genetically determined.
               However, it is not known how many traits display genetic control
               of stochastic noise nor how broadly these stochastic loci are
               distributed within the genome. Understanding these questions is
               critical to our understanding of quantitative traits and how
               they relate to the underlying causal loci, especially since
               stochastic noise may be directly influenced by underlying
               changes in the wiring of regulatory networks. We identified QTLs
               controlling natural variation in stochastic noise of
               glucosinolates, plant defense metabolites, as well as QTLs for
               stochastic noise of related transcripts. These loci included
               stochastic noise QTLs unique for either transcript or metabolite
               variation. Validation of these loci showed that genetic
               polymorphism within the regulatory network alters stochastic
               noise independent of effects on corresponding average levels. We
               examined this phenomenon more globally, using transcriptomic
               datasets, and found that the Arabidopsis transcriptome exhibits
               significant, heritable differences in stochastic noise. Further
               analysis allowed us to identify QTLs that control genomic
               stochastic noise. Some genomic QTL were in common with those
               altering average transcript abundance, while others were unique
               to stochastic noise. Using a single isogenic population, we
               confirmed that natural variation at ELF3 alters stochastic noise
               in the circadian clock and metabolism. Since polymorphisms
               controlling stochastic noise in genomic phenotypes exist within
               wild germplasm for naturally selected phenotypes, this suggests
               that analysis of Arabidopsis evolution should account for
               genetic control of stochastic variance and average phenotypes.
               It remains to be determined if natural genetic variation
               controlling stochasticity is equally distributed across the
               genomes of other multi-cellular eukaryotes.",

               investigated both experimentally and theoretically. However, it
               remains unknown to what extent robustness varies between
               individuals, and whether factors buffering environmental
               variation also buffer genetic variation. Here we introduce a
               quantitative genetic approach to these issues, and apply this
               approach to data from three species. In mice, we find suggestive
               evidence that for hundreds of gene expression traits, robustness
               is polymorphic and can be genetically mapped to discrete genomic
               loci. Moreover, we find that the polymorphisms buffering genetic
               variation are distinct from those buffering environmental
               variation. In fact, these two classes have quite distinct
               mechanistic bases: environmental buffers of gene expression are
               predominantly sex-specific and trans-acting, whereas genetic
               buffers are not sex-specific and often cis-acting. Data from
               studies of morphological and life-history traits in plants and
               yeast support the distinction between polymorphisms buffering
               genetic and environmental variation, and further suggest that
               loci buffering different types of environmental variation do
               overlap with one another. These preliminary results suggest that
               naturally occurring polymorphisms affecting phenotypic
               robustness could be abundant, and that these polymorphisms may

               genetic mechanisms to yield persistence of specific features

               isogenic mice of eight different commonly used strains by
               analyzing to what extent environmental variation contributed to
               individuality in each of the eight genotypes, using a previously

               studies, substantial variability among mice of the same inbred

               controversial topic, hampered in part by lack of empirical
               evidence. Traditionally, epistasis is inferred on the basis of
               non-independence of genotypic values between loci for a given
               trait. However, epistasis for fitness should also have a genomic
               footprint. To capture this signal, we have developed a simple
               approach that relies on detecting genotype ratio distortion as a
               sign of epistasis, and we apply this method to a large panel of
               Drosophila melanogaster recombinant inbred lines. Here we
               confirm experimentally that instances of genotype ratio
               distortion represent loci with epistatic fitness effects; we

               interacting alleles. This observation has important implications

               variance-association mapping analyses to identify expression
               variability QTLs (evQTLs), i.e. genomic loci associated with
               gene expression variance, in humans. We discovered that common
               genetic variants may contribute to increasing gene expression
               variance via two distinct modes of action---epistasis and
               destabilization. Specifically, epistasis explains a quarter of
               the identified evQTLs, of which the formation is attributed to
               the presence of `third-party' eQTLs that influence the gene
               expression mean in a fraction, rather than the entire set, of
               sampled individuals. On the other hand, the destabilization
               model explains the other three-quarters of evQTLs, caused by
               mutations that disrupt the stability of the transcription
               process of genes. To show the destabilizing effect, we measured
               discordant gene expression between monozygotic twins, and
               estimated the stability of gene expression in single samples

               between individuals. Explaining the genetic basis of
               quantitative trait variation requires comprehensively accounting
               for genetic and nongenetic factors as well as their
               interactions. The growth of microbial cells can be characterized
               by a lag duration, an exponential growth phase, and a stationary
               phase. Parameters that characterize these growth phases can vary
               among genotypes (phenotypic variation), environmental conditions
               (phenotypic plasticity), and among isogenic cells in a given
               environment (phenotypic variability). We used a high-throughput
               microscopy assay to map genetic loci determining variation in
               lag duration and exponential growth rate in growth rate-limiting
               and nonlimiting glucose concentrations, using segregants from a
               cross of two natural isolates of the budding yeast,
               Saccharomyces cerevisiae We find that some quantitative trait
               loci (QTL) are common between traits and environments whereas
               some are unique, exhibiting gene-by-environment interactions.
               Furthermore, whereas variation in the central tendency of growth
               rate or lag duration is explained by many additive loci,
               differences in phenotypic variability are primarily the result
               of genetic interactions. We used bulk segregant mapping to
               increase QTL resolution by performing whole-genome sequencing of
               complex mixtures of an advanced intercross mapping population
               grown in selective conditions using glucose-limited chemostats.
               We find that sequence variation in the high-affinity glucose
               transporter HXT7 contributes to variation in growth rate and lag
               duration. Allele replacements of the entire locus, as well as of
               a single polymorphic amino acid, reveal that the effect of
               variation in HXT7 depends on genetic, and allelic, background.
               Amplifications of HXT7 are frequently selected in experimental
               evolution in glucose-limited environments, but we find that HXT7
               amplifications result in antagonistic pleiotropy that is absent

               We used wild house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) from Gough
               Island (GI), which diverged recently from their mainland
               counterparts, to characterize the genetics of recombination rate

               rates by immunofluorescence cytology in spermatocytes from 240
               F2 males generated from intercrosses between GI-derived mice and

               probably have broad biological and methodological implications

  abstract  = "Animals typically display among-individual differences in
               behavior that are consistent over time (i.e., personality).
               These differences are often triggered by variable individual
               responses to environmental stress factors experienced during
               life, such as competition for resources and risk of predation.
               While the causes underlying animal personality are considered to
               be an issue of prime importance, it is still unknown whether
               personality emerges and develops over ontogeny if the main
               sources of behavioral differentiation are absent. Here, we
               tested whether personality emerged and was strengthened during
               the lifetime of Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), once
               intraspecific competition and risk of predation were completely
               removed and genetic and maternal differences minimized. We found
               that individual differences in behavior were overall repeatable
               over ontogeny (i.e., personality was manifested). Personality
               was, however, not detectable in juvenile individuals but emerged
               during and after their sexual maturation. The emergence of
               personality was triggered by the decline in behavioral
               plasticity of individuals over ontogeny, while differences in
               behavior among individuals did not vary with age. Our results
               suggest that animal personality might be inevitable and emerge
               in fish under laboratory-controlled conditions even in absence
               of extrinsic factors that typically lead to behavioral
               differentiation. The decline of behavioral plasticity over
               lifetime might be a relevant mechanism for the development of
               personality in animals.Significance statementIncreasing evidence
               suggests that animals have personality, that is, individuals
               consistently differ in behavior among each other (e.g., bold and
               shy or social and non-social individuals). Personality
               differences among animals should be, by definition, consistent
               over time and often caused by environmental challenges
               experienced early in life. In this study, we observed that
               personality differences were not present at juvenile age in
               social fish but emerged later in their life, despite the fact
               that environmental challenges (i.e., predation risk and
               competition for space, food, and mates) were absent. Personality
               differences strengthened over lifetime, resulting from declines
               in individual behavioral plasticity. Our results suggest that
               the decline in behavioral plasticity with age may represent a
               relevant mechanism for behavioral differentiation in animals, in
               agreement with evidences from the human literature on
               age-related loss in behavioral plasticity.",

               modeling technique was investigated for sib-pair linkage
               analysis using simulation studies and real data applications. We
               considered 4 heterogeneous dispersion settings according to a
               signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the various statistical models
               based on the Haseman-Elston regression model. RESULTS: Our
               numerical studies demonstrated that susceptibility loci could be
               detected well by modeling the dispersion parameter
               appropriately. In particular, the HGLM had better performance

               identify multiple markers showing linkage to familial complex

  abstract  = "Cryptic genetic variation (CGV) refers to genetic variants whose
               effects are buffered in most conditions but manifest
               phenotypically upon specific genetic and environmental
               perturbations. Despite having a central role in adaptation,
               contribution of CGV to regulation of quantitative traits is
               unclear. Instead, a relatively simplistic architecture of
               additive genetic loci is known to regulate phenotypic variation
               in most traits. In this paper, we investigate the regulation of
               CGV and its implication on the genetic architecture of
               quantitative traits at a genome-wide level. We use a previously
               published dataset of biparental recombinant population of
               Saccharomyces cerevisiae phenotyped in 34 diverse environments
               to perform single locus, two-locus, and covariance mapping. We
               identify loci that have independent additive effects as well as
               those which regulate the phenotypic manifestation of other
               genetic variants (variance QTL). We find that whereas additive
               genetic variance is predominant, a higher order genetic
               interaction network regulates variation in certain environments.
               Despite containing pleiotropic loci, with effects across
               environments, these genetic networks are highly environment
               specific. CGV is buffered under most allelic combinations of
               these networks and perturbed only in rare combinations resulting
               in high phenotypic variance. The presence of such environment
               specific genetic networks is the underlying cause of abundant
               gene--environment interactions. We demonstrate that overlaying
               identified molecular networks on such genetic networks can
               identify potential candidate genes and underlying mechanisms
               regulating phenotypic variation. Such an integrated approach

               (parity, 1--6) in 15 herds from 1981 to 2007. The estimated
               additive genetic variance for the mean and dispersion were 32.25
               and 0.0139; both of these values had low standard errors. The
               genetic standard deviation for dispersion of DFS was 0.117,
               indicating that decreasing the estimated breeding value of
               dispersion by one genetic standard deviation can increase the
               uniformity by 12\%. A strong positive genetic correlation

              which phenotypes vary (variance-controlling quantitative trait

              uses genetic relatedness as a tool to obtain unbiased estimates

              approach, which utilizes random variation between siblings in

              include the Levene's test, the Lepage test, and the D-test, but
              suffer from their limitations of lack of robustness or lack of
              power. We propose a semiparametric model and a novel pairwise
              conditional likelihood ratio test. Specifically, the
              semiparametric model is designed to identify the combined
              differences in higher moments among genotypic groups. The
              pairwise likelihood is constructed based on conditioning
              procedure, where the unknown reference distribution is
              eliminated. We show that the proposed pairwise likelihood ratio
              test has a simple asymptotic chi-square distribution, which does
              not require permutation or bootstrap procedures. Simulation
              studies show that the proposed test performs well in controlling
              Type I errors and having competitive power in identifying the
              differences across genotypic groups. In addition, the proposed
              test has certain robustness to model mis-specifications. The
              proposed test is illustrated by an example of identifying both
              mean and variances effects in body mass index using the

              association of a quantitative trait",
  author   = "Ma, Li and Hoffman, Gabriel and Keinan, Alon",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The X chromosome plays an important role in human
              diseases and traits. However, few X-linked associations have been
              reported in genome-wide association studies, partly due to
              analytical complications and low statistical power. RESULTS: In
              this study, we propose tests of X-linked association that
              capitalize on variance heterogeneity caused by various factors,
              predominantly the process of X-inactivation. In the presence of
              X-inactivation, the expression of one copy of the chromosome is
              randomly silenced. Due to the consequent elevated randomness of
              expressed variants, females that are heterozygotes for a
              quantitative trait locus might exhibit higher phenotypic variance
              for that trait. We propose three tests that build on this
              phenomenon: 1) A test for inflated variance in heterozygous
              females; 2) A weighted association test; and 3) A combined test.
              Test 1 captures the novel signal proposed herein by directly
              testing for higher phenotypic variance of heterozygous than
              homozygous females. As a test of variance it is generally less
              powerful than standard tests of association that consider means,
              which is supported by extensive simulations. Test 2 is similar to
              a standard association test in considering the phenotypic mean,
              but differs by accounting for (rather than testing) the variance
              heterogeneity. As expected in light of X-inactivation, this test
              is slightly more powerful than a standard association test.
              Finally, test 3 further improves power by combining the results
              of the first two tests. We applied the these tests to the ARIC
              cohort data and identified a novel X-linked association near gene
              AFF2 with blood pressure, which was not significant based on
              standard association testing of mean blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS:
              Variance-based tests examine overdispersion, thereby providing a
              complementary type of signal to a standard association test. Our
              results point to the potential to improve power of detecting
              X-linked associations in the presence of variance heterogeneity.",

              under genetic control, but also the variation around that level.
              In other words, genotypes do not only differ in mean, but also in
              (residual) variation around the genotypic mean. New statistical
              methods facilitate gaining knowledge on the genetic architecture
              of complex traits such as phenotypic variability. Here we study
              litter size (total number born) and its variation in a Large
              White pig population using a Double Hierarchical Generalized
              Linear model, and perform a genome-wide association study using a
              Bayesian method. RESULTS: In total, 10 significant single
              nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected for total number
              born (TNB) and 9 SNPs for variability of TNB (varTNB). Those SNPs
              explained 0.83 \% of genetic variance in TNB and 1.44 \% in
              varTNB. The most significant SNP for TNB was detected on Sus
              scrofa chromosome (SSC) 11. A possible candidate gene for TNB is
              ENOX1, which is involved in cell growth and survival. On SSC7,
              two possible candidate genes for varTNB are located. The first
              gene is coding a swine heat shock protein 90 (HSPCB = Hsp90),
              which is a well-studied gene stabilizing morphological traits in
              Drosophila and Arabidopsis. The second gene is VEGFA, which is
              activated in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis in the fetus.
              Furthermore, the genetic correlation between additive genetic
              effects on TNB and on its variation was 0.49. This indicates that
              the current selection to increase TNB will also increase the
              varTNB. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the
              first study reporting SNPs associated with variation of a trait
              in pigs. Detected genomic regions associated with varTNB can be
              used in genomic selection to decrease varTNB, which is highly
              desirable to avoid very small or very large litters in pigs.

  author   = "Le Rouzic, Arnaud",
  abstract = "Epistasis, i.e., the fact that gene effects depend on the genetic
              background, is a direct consequence of the complexity of genetic
              architectures. Despite this, most of the models used in
              evolutionary and quantitative genetics pay scant attention to
              genetic interactions. For instance, the traditional decomposition
              of genetic effects models epistasis as noise around the
              evolutionarily-relevant additive effects. Such an approach is
              only valid if it is assumed that there is no general pattern
              among interactions-a highly speculative scenario. Systematic
              interactions generate directional epistasis, which has major
              evolutionary consequences. In spite of its importance,
              directional epistasis is rarely measured or reported by
              quantitative geneticists, not only because its relevance is
              generally ignored, but also due to the lack of simple,
              operational, and accessible methods for its estimation. This
              paper describes conceptual and statistical tools that can be used
              to estimate directional epistasis from various kinds of data,

              stochastic variation in transcriptional processes within
              multi-cellular eukaryotes. However, little is known about how
              genetic diversity can control stochastic variation within more
              non-cell autonomous phenotypes. Using an Arabidopsis reciprocal
              RIL population, we showed that there is significant genetic
              diversity influencing stochastic variation in the plant
              metabolome, defense chemistry, and growth. This genetic diversity
              included loci specific for the stochastic variation of each
              phenotypic class that did not affect the other phenotypic classes

              phenotypic level like metabolism and not permeate up or down to
              different phenotypic levels. Further, the genomic variation
              within the plastid and mitochondria also had significant effects
              on the stochastic variation of all phenotypic classes. The
              genetic influence over stochastic variation within the metabolome

              the same metabolic pathway frequently showing different levels of

              genetic diversity and a wider range of stochastic variation for

              investigate the influences of genetic and nongenetic factors on

              variability QTL (evQTL)--i.e., genetic loci associated with the

              identified evQTL for 99, 56, and 79 genes in lymphoblastoid cell
              lines, skin, and fat, respectively. The differences in gene
              expression, measured by the relative mean difference (RMD),
              tended to be larger between pairs of dizygotic (DZ) twins than

              variance heterogeneity (LRT(MV)) or either effect alone (LRT(M)
              or LRT(V)) in the presence of covariates. Using extensive

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Canalization is defined as the stability of a
              genotype against minor variations in both environment and
              genetics. Genetic variation in degree of canalization causes
              heterogeneity of within-family variance. The aims of this study
              are twofold: (1) quantify genetic heterogeneity of
              (within-family) residual variance in Atlantic salmon and (2) test
              whether the observed heterogeneity of (within-family) residual
              variance can be explained by simple scaling effects. RESULTS:
              Analysis of body weight in Atlantic salmon using a double
              hierarchical generalized linear model (DHGLM) revealed
              substantial heterogeneity of within-family variance. The 95\%
              prediction interval for within-family variance ranged from ~0.4
              to 1.2 kg2, implying that the within-family variance of the most
              extreme high families is expected to be approximately three times
              larger than the extreme low families. For cross-sectional data,
              DHGLM with an animal mean sub-model resulted in severe bias,
              while a corresponding sire-dam model was appropriate.
              Heterogeneity of variance was not sensitive to Box-Cox
              transformations of phenotypes, which implies that heterogeneity
              of variance exists beyond what would be expected from simple
              scaling effects. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial heterogeneity of
              within-family variance was found for body weight in Atlantic
              salmon. A tendency towards higher variance with higher means
              (scaling effects) was observed, but heterogeneity of
              within-family variance existed beyond what could be explained by
              simple scaling effects. For cross-sectional data, using the
              animal mean sub-model in the DHGLM resulted in biased estimates
              of variance components, which differed substantially both from a
              standard linear mean animal model and a sire-dam DHGLM model.
              Although genetic differences in canalization were observed,
              selection for increased canalization is difficult, because there
              is limited individual information for the variance sub-model,
              especially when based on cross-sectional data. Furthermore,
              potential macro-environmental changes (diet, climatic region,
              etc.) may make genetic heterogeneity of variance a less stable

              measured the spontaneous locomotor behavior of flies walking

              locomotor handedness, an assay optimized to measure variability.
              We discovered that some lines had consistently high levels of
              intragenotypic variability among individuals, whereas lines with
              low variability behaved as although they tossed a coin at each

  abstract = "Phenotypic variability is present even when genetic and
              environmental differences between cells are reduced to the
              greatest possible extent. For example, genetically identical
              bacteria display differing levels of resistance to antibiotics,
              clonal yeast populations demonstrate morphological and
              growth-rate heterogeneity, and mouse blastomeres from the same
              embryo have stochastic differences in gene expression. However,
              the distributions of phenotypes present among isogenic organisms
              are often overlooked; instead, many studies focus on population
              aggregates such as the mean. The details of these distributions
              are relevant to major questions in diverse fields, including the
              evolution of antimicrobial-drug and chemotherapy resistance. We
              review emerging experimental and statistical techniques that

  abstract = "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have become the focus of
              the statistical analysis of complex traits in humans,
              successfully shedding light on several aspects of genetic
              architecture and biological aetiology. Single-nucleotide
              polymorphisms (SNPs) are usually modelled as having additive,
              cumulative and independent effects on the phenotype. Although
              evidently a useful approach, it is often argued that this is not
              a realistic biological model and that epistasis (that is, the
              statistical interaction between SNPs) should be included. The
              purpose of this Review is to summarize recent directions in
              methodology for detecting epistasis and to discuss evidence of
              the role of epistasis in human complex trait variation. We also
              discuss the relevance of epistasis in the context of GWASs and
              potential hazards in the interpretation of statistical
              interaction terms.",

@ARTICLE{Ronnegard2012-qo,
  title    = "Recent developments in statistical methods for detecting genetic
              loci affecting phenotypic variability",
  author   = "R{\"o}nneg{\aa}rd, Lars and Valdar, William",
  abstract = "A number of recent works have introduced statistical methods for
              detecting genetic loci that affect phenotypic variability, which
              we refer to as variability-controlling quantitative trait loci
              (vQTL). These are genetic variants whose allelic state predicts
              how much phenotype values will vary about their expected means.
              Such loci are of great potential interest in both human and
              non-human genetic studies, one reason being that a detected vQTL
              could represent a previously undetected interaction with other
              genes or environmental factors. The simultaneous publication of
              these new methods in different journals has in many cases
              precluded opportunity for comparison. We survey some of these
              methods, the respective trade-offs they imply, and the
              connections between them. The methods fall into three main
              groups: classical non-parametric, fully parametric, and
              semi-parametric two-stage approximations. Choosing between
              alternatives involves balancing the need for robustness,
              flexibility, and speed. For each method, we identify important
              assumptions and limitations, including those of practical
              importance, such as their scope for including covariates and
              random effects. We show in simulations that both parametric
              methods and their semi-parametric approximations can give
              elevated false positive rates when they ignore mean-variance
              relationships intrinsic to the data generation process. We
              conclude that choice of method depends on the trait distribution,
              the need to include non-genetic covariates, and the population
              size and structure, coupled with a critical evaluation of how
              these fit with the assumptions of the statistical model.",

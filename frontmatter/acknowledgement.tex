Many people and institutions have supported me while I completed the work presented here.

First, the Valdar lab.
I have greatly appreciated the opportunity to work with and learn from Will Valdar alongside Greg Keele, Paul Maurizio, Dan Oreper, Yanwei Cai, and Kathie Sun.
I have been allowed the time to think about what I'm doing in a way that is not guaranteed in graduate school.

Second, the BCB program.
Tim Elston, Jonathan Cornett, and Cara Marlow were indispensible in helping me solve all the issues of graduate school that aren't research.

Third, the MD-PhD program.
The ``big picture'' guidance and support I've received from Gene Orringer, Toni Darville, Mohanish Deshmukh, Alison Regan, Carol Herion has kept me moving forward in a productive direction no matter how thick the morass of graduate school felt.

Finally, my family.
My mom, dad, and brother have been patient with me when I needed it.
Conversations with my mother always seem to end on the conclusion that I am perfect in every way --- a comforting lie.
Conversations with my father tend the other direction with a clear-headed analysis of where I've gone wrong --- a hard truth.

In terms of giving credit where it is due, my grandparents deserve a fair share.
From childhood, my mom's parents shared with me a love of reading and writing.
Most of the time my grandmother came over to visit, she brought some books from the bookstore where she worked.
I should have read them!
My dad's parents brought in another piece of the puzzle.
With visits to the Franklin institute and a home experimenter kit, they encouraged the enthusiasm for science that probably nudged me toward the path I'm on now.
